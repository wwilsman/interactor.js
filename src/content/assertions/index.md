description: Built-in interactor assertions

Interactor assertions can be found nested under the `assert` property. Most
assertions mirror their corresponding properties and the others mirror helpers
that return information about the DOM element. All built-in assertions can be
overridden for custom interactors.

- [Attribute](/assertions/attribute)
- [Disabled](/assertions/disabled)
- [Exists](/assertions/exists)
- [Focusable](/assertions/focusable)
- [Focused](/assertions/focused)
- [Matches](/assertions/matches)
- [Property](/assertions/property)
- [Scrollable](/assertions/scrollable)
- [ScrollableX](/assertions/scrollablex)
- [ScrollableY](/assertions/scrollably)
- [Text](/assertions/text)
- [Value](/assertions/value)

Other assert methods do not make assertions, but instead change the behavior of
an assertion or a group of assertions. These assert methods cannot be
overridden.

- [Not](/assertions/not)
- [Validate](/assertions/validate)
- [Remains](/assertions/remains)
- [F](/assertions/f)
